## Assignment 1B

### What are Channels and Kernels?

**Channels**: If we consider an image then channels are different components in an image. In a RGB image we have three channels(red, green and blue) that stores all the important values and features that define that image.

**Kernels**: Kernels are the filters or matrixes that extract the dominant or required features from the channels of an image.
Kernels are also known as feature extractors.

### Why should we only (well mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?

We prefer using 3x3 kernels because it helps us in keeping the parameters/weights to minimum and also helps us in keeping the symmetry intact thus making it much easier to process the image. Also, NVIDIA GPUs are mainly optimised for 3x3 kernels thus models with 3x3 kernels run faster making the model efficient.

### How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199?

Given an input image of 199x199 of size where we are asked to perform 3x3 convolution to reach output size 1x1.
Let us assume that the number of convolution required is x. Then,

199 = 1 + (x-1) x 2 => n = 100. 
This means 100 convolution layers are required to reach 1x1 output.

Now, letâ€™s validate the above calculation.

199x199 | 197x197 | 195x195 | 193x193 | 191x191 | 189x189 | 187x187 | 185x185 | 183x183 |
181x181 | 179x179 | 177x177 | 175x175 | 173x173 | 171x171 | 169x169 | 167x167 | 165x165 |
163x163 | 161x161 | 159x159 | 157x157 | 155x155 | 153x153 | 151x151 | 149x149 | 147x147 |
145x145 | 143x143 | 141x141 | 139x139 | 137x137 | 135x135 | 133x133 | 131x131 | 129x129 |
127x127 | 125x125 | 123x123 | 121x121 | 119x119 | 117x117 | 115x115 | 113x113 | 111x111 |
109x109 | 107x107 | 105x105 | 103x103 | 101x101 | 99x99 | 97x97 | 95x95 | 93x93 |
91x91 | 89x89 | 87x87 | 85x85 | 83x83 | 81x81 | 79x79 | 77x77 | 75x75 | 73x73 | 71x71 |
69x69 | 67x67 | 65x65 | 63x63 | 61x61 | 59x59 | 57x57 | 55x55 | 53x53 | 51x51 | 49x49 |
47x47 | 45x45 | 43x43 | 41x41 | 39x39 | 37x37 | 35x35 | 33x33 | 31x31 | 29x29 | 27x27 |
25x25 | 23x23 | 21x21 | 19x19 | 17x17 | 15x15 | 13x13 | 11x11 | 9x9 | 7x7 | 5x5 | 3x3 | 1x1

The above calculation clearly shows that it requires 100 convolutions are required to get an output of 1x1 given an image size of 199x199.
